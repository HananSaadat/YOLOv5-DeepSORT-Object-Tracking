# YOLOv5-DeepSORT-Object-Tracking
This repository contains a real-time object detection and tracking pipeline using the YOLOv5 object detection model and the DeepSORT multi-object tracking algorithm. The project demonstrates the integration of these powerful models to achieve accurate and efficient detection and tracking of objects in video streams.
